## Introduction
To allow organizations using enterprise business applications to determine an achievable, tailored-to approach defining actionable targets and measurable results, with the capability to scale by strengthening people, leveraging processes, and enhancing the use of tools. The Core Business Security Application (CBAS) project is designed to combine different industry standards and expertise from various security professionals to provide a comprehensive framework to align the measures for enterprise application security with the organization's security strategy. As a result, a framework is created to improve the security governance of the use of enterprise application technology.

## Background
Core business applications or enterprise business applications are beneficial to organizations in several ways. Some of these benefits include

> - Combining different business processes under one solution
> - Improving business performance
> - Higher productivity by eliminating redundant processes
> - Flexibility and mobility
> - Easier collaboration between different organizational teams
> - Centralized data

Even though there are numerous benefits that these solutions have, security threats have not decreased. Maintaining, implementing, and deploying security controls and/or information security standards around such solutions is still facing challenges. Some of these challenges include

> - Little to no understanding of the solutions in place
> - Security professionals not involved in the initial phases of deploying and implementing such solutions
> - Security controls being built after the solution is operational and functional; causing a blow back from business units

## NO MONKEY Security Matrix

The NO MONKEY Security Matrix, combines elements of the security operational functions, defined by NIST, and IPAC model, created by NO MONKEY and explained below, into a functional graph. The Security Matrix serves as a starting point to

- Visually show what areas within an organization can be improved
- Identify responsibility and knowledge gaps that are aligned to the areas of the Security Matrix

### IPAC model

NO MONKEY have come up with these four different security areas to focus the security topics to a core business application. The areas are



> - **Integration:** focus of different integration scenarios within systems themselves, as well as third-party tools integrating with a core business application environment, including proprietary as well as non-proprietary communication protocols and interfaces. Topics include secure architecture, security design, and general security operation concepts.
>
> - **Platform:** consideration of the vulnerabilities, hardening, and configuration of the core business applications. Includes the review of security features and weaknesses in the software's operations, setup, and security management.
> - **Access:** consideration of access control and user authorizations measures and methodologies of core business applications.
> - **Customization:** consideration of the customization of core business applications - including change management, custom code, business customizing, legacy interfaces, and add-ons.

## Objectives

While there are many enterprise solutions out there, SAP has been proven to dominate the ERP market. With that in mind, the initial CBAS project release focuses on SAP solutions (CBAS-SAP).

The CBAS-SAP objectives and goals are defined in the [Objectives page](https://github.com/NO-MONKEY/CBAS/blob/master/Objectives.md)

## Getting Started

The below video illustrates how you can get started with the Security Aptitude Assessment and Analysis; which serves as the first part of the CBAS project.
