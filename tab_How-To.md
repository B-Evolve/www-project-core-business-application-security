# Security Aptitude Analysis - How To

The following document provides organizations and individuals with the necessary information on how to conduct the Security Aptitude Analysis (SAA) and perform the required analysis to determine the operat ional gaps within the No Monkey Security matrix

Required documents:
- Security_Aptitude_Analysis.xlsx
  - The Security_Aptitude_Analysis document provides the analysis of the assessments conducted within the organization

- SAA_Assessment.xlsx
  - The assessment required to be filled

- Survey.xlsx
  - This document will be used to combine all assessment results

**"The more the survey takers are, the better the results and analysis become to understand the gap areas within your organization"**

To get started, download a copy of the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_, _"SAA_Assessment"_ and _"Survey"_ documents from the [Analysis folder](https://github.com/NO-MONKEY/CBAS/tree/master/Analysis)

Assessment requirements:
- Each assessment must uniquely be identified by an ID number (i.e. 1,2,3...)

- The _"Data"_ sheet inside the assessment should be exported
to the generic file _"Survey.xlsx"_.

- Once you have copied or exported the data to the _"Survey.xlsx"_ file, edit the data source path in the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_ file to change it to your preferred location

- Once you open the _"Security_Aptitude_Analysis"_ the file will prompt to update the data source _(this will depend on the excel version you are running)_
