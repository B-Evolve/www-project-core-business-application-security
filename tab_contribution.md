# Areas of Contribution
We have different areas that we love for you to help us with. You don't need to be a security expert to help us out. If you enjoy developing new tools, designing pages, creating documentation, or even translating, we want you!

We are adopting an agile methodology while creating the projects' roadmap and developing the CBAS project. The [Roadmap](https://owasp.org/www-project-core-business-application-security/#div-roadmap) page will give you a clear idea of how we plan to develop our first area of concentration, CBAS-SAP, and the [Project map](https://github.com/NO-MONKEY/CBAS/projects/1) might also help you decide.

If you still want to help but not sure how, contact us and we are happy to discuss it
